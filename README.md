#  MyResume
This app is an extension of the Hello app project created as part of Apple's **Develop in Swift Fundamentals** ([Teacher](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals-teacher-guide/id1511184161)) and ([Student](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals/id1511184145)) course. The project can be found in Lesson 2.8: Displaying Data starting on page 368 in the Student book and starting on page 253 in the student book. 

## Background üë©üèº‚Äçüéì üßëüèø‚Äçüéì üë®üèΩ‚Äçüéì üë©üèª‚Äçüíª üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª
This project works under the assumption that you or your students have built the Hello app project using Apple's **Develop in Swift Fundamentals** course. If you have not done that already you may need to go and do that before creating this app. However, the basics of this app in the Hello app project is that it is a single view controller with two labels and an image. So, if you have not built the Hello app previously, you can simply take a look at the first screencast to see how the app is set up. Further, I think this project is best done after you and your students have worked through Lesson 1.8: System View Controllers in Apple's **Develop in Swift Data Collections** ([Teacher](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-data-collections-teacher-guide/id1511184146) and [Student](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-data-collections/id1511183970)) course. However, if you only teach the first book in the Develop in Swift curriculum (**Develop in Swift Fundamentals**) this project also reinforces the concepts of Optionals (lesson 3.1), Segues and Navigation Controllers (lesson 3.6), and Tab Bar Controllers (lesson 3.7) . I use this app as a way to reinforce the concepts taught in Systems View Controllers lesson in the second book and the Optionals lesson in the first book. The Optionals lesson is Lesson 3.1 in Apple's **Development in Swift Fundamentals**  ([Teacher](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals-teacher-guide/id1511184161) and [Student](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals/id1511184145)) course. The Optionals lesson is in Unit 3: Navigation and Workflows and starts on page 367 in the Student book. I absolutely LOVE teaching this lesson and showing students the power of Optionals and how I find it to be one of the best language features in Swift for writing powerful and safe code.  This project gives me yet another opportunity to (drone on and on as my students might privately say) talk about Optionals. 

This project also gives me yet another opportunity to teach versioning, software iteration, and the software development process. More importantly, though, the MyResume project uses the SafariServices and PDFKit frameworks. I think it is important for students to at the very least get an introduction to implementing an Apple framework into a project. This app uses two. I chose to use Safari Services and PDFKit because they are relatively straight-forward and thus easier to use in a project. This means that students will be able to see how quickly and easily they can access and use Apple's Frameworks with a little bit of reading, reviewing some tutorials, and just a few lines of code. This has the potential to be the most meaningful part of the project for students.

## Purpose üñ• üíª üì±
The general purpose of this project is to review and practice using Optionals in code, creating segues, and making multiple-screen apps. Additionally, this project provides me another chance to teach my students to the process of software improvement and iteration by taking some software they created and adding functionality to it. In doing this I am also able to introduce the concepts of software versioning and using GitHub for software creation, versioning, and the proper (and safe) way to iterate on software using branching and merging. If you are going to do this project individually or with your students, I am going to make the assumption that you have access to Mac hardware and, just as important, Apple first-party software such as Keynote, Preview, and Pages.

## Process üë©üèæ‚Äçüè´ üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ üë®üèª‚Äçüíª üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª
The general process and flow of this project is in the format of an Apple Teacher Portfolio lesson. There are three parts/phases to the lesson
- Activate
- Explore 
- Apply
You can learn more about and sign up for Apple Teacher here: [Apple Teacher](https://www.apple.com/education/k12/teacher-resources/). 

### Activate
We want our students to activate any prior knowledge on the topic. Since the students have previously made the Hello app, they will all have the starting point of the project. However, the goal of the project is to greatly improve the app and add more advanced iOS features. As a starting point, students should have a resum√© made when this part is complete. Here is the activity I use with my students:

1. Open Pages and create a blank document. Create bulleted list of your experiences that best highlight why someone would want to employ you. Add a separate bulleted list of your skills that best highlight why someone would want to employ you.
2. In Pages, create a new document and open multiple resume templates.
3. Choose a template and create a resum√©.
4. Open and review the Hello app.
5. Students should now think, pair, share ways they could incorporate parts of their resum√© into the Hello app to better introduce themselves to others and potential employers. Students will do this in a whiteboard session as it is done when discussing app features and code reviews.

### Explore
Now that students are ready to put their best foot forward and market themselves to a prospective employer we want them to create a web presence in the form of a personal/professional website, online portfolio, or blog so that we can incorporate it into the app.

1. Introduce students to some of the free website/portfolio sites: Wix, Weebly, SquareSpace, andTumblr.
2. Decide upon what skills, talents, knowledge they want to showcase on their website.
3. Have students build an introductory website that can be expanded to include learning and professional skills. 
4. Review in [Apple's Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com) what can be done to include both a traditional paper resum√© and a web-based resum√©/website/portfolio. 


### Apply 
In this part of the project we build the app.
*Note: There is an MyResume project PDF file in the app with this steps listed below, screenshots of some the specific settings screenshots, and links to screencasts of the app creation process.*


1. Open the existing Hello app
2. Add a button to the screen that is centered and just under your introduction label. Set the size to 25.
3. Add two buttons under the Call Me button. One button should be ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù and one should be ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù. Set the font size to 17 for each button.
4. Set the font color for each button if you want to change from the default blue color.
5. Click and drag to select the name label, your picture, and introduction label. In the Menu Bar click Editor > Resolve Auto Layout Issues > Add Missing Constraints.
6. Select the Call Me button. Click Add New Alignment Constraints. Select ‚ÄúCenter Horizontally in Container‚Äù and click ‚ÄúAdd 1 Constraint‚Äù.
7. Click and drag to select the Skills label and the Education label. In the Menu Bar click Editor > Resolve Auto Layout Issues > Add Missing Constraints.
8. From the Object Library add two View Controllers in Main Storyboard. 
9. Add a label to the top of each of the new View Controllers. Use the alignment guides to center the label near the top of the screen.
10. Change one label to Experience and the other label to Skills and set the font to be Title 1 for each label.
11. Create a ‚ÄúShow‚Äù segue from the Experience button to the View Controller with the Experience label.
12. Create a ‚ÄúShow‚Äù segue from the Skills button to the View Controller with the Skills label.
13. Add a label to the the Experience screen and to the Skills screen. For each label, select the label and use the drag handles to stretch the label to the leading and trailing edge of the safe edges of the screen. Now, use the top and bottom drag handles to make label cover about half of the screen. Use the alignment guides to center the label horizontally and vertically.
14. Set the number of lines for each label to zero in the Attributes Inspector. 
15. Open the Pages document with the bulleted lists for experiences and skills. Copy the experiences bulleted list and paste it into the label on the Experience screen. Adjust the label size and position to display the text. Now, do the same for the skills bulleted list.
16. Build and run the app. Students will be able to navigate to either the Experience or Skills screen, but then‚Ä¶ Zoinks!! There is not way to return to the Home Screen of the app. 
17. Ask students for suggestions. You have two main options.
    1. Add a button to the screen, change the text to Back in the Attributes inspector, create a backToHomeScreen function in ViewController.swift using the UIStoryBoardSegue as its only parameter as was done in Lesson 3.6 and explained on page 412 in Develop in Swift Fundamentals. This option is a lot of steps.
    2. Embed the Home Screen in a Navigation Controller - this is method I use with my students.
18. The Navigation Controller on the Home Screen will now cover the name label from the original project. We will later set the title in the navigation bar to be your name programmatically.
19. Build and run. You can now navigate to the Experience and Skills screens and then return back to the app Home Screen.
20. Open Main.storyboard. We now want to create an action that will allow the phone to call our number.
21. Open the Assistant Editor.
22. Create an action from the Call Me button by control-dragging from the Call Me button to just under the `viewDidLoad` method. Name the function something similar to `callMe` or `callMyName` (where MyName is your name).
23. Create a `phoneNumber` constant at the top of the class and set it as a String to your phone number.
24. Add this code to the `callMe` method.
    ```swift
    // this line of code enables a physical device to call our phone number so the person can leave us a voicemail
    if let url = NSURL(string: "tel://\(phoneNumber)") {
    UIApplication.shared.open(url as URL, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)
    // this line of code demonstrates that the call button will work and actually call the number. This is inserted to demo functionality
    // since the Simulator cannot make a phone call. This line will print a string to the console.
    print("The phone is calling my number. Voicemail will be triggered automatically.")
    ```
25. How can we make it better?
    1. Have the Skills  button display our personal webpage, blog, portfolio, etc.
    2. Have the Experience page display our actual resume.
26. Displaying our webpage, blog, or portfolio
    1. Go to the Source Control Navigator and add a new branch and name it ‚Äúwebportfolio‚Äù
    2. Break the connection from the Skills button to the Skills screen by clicking on the segue that connects the Home Screen to the Skills screen and then delete that arrow.
    3. At the very top of ViewController.swift file above the import UIKit statement, add this statement: 
    ```swift
    import SafariServices
    ```
27. At the top of ViewController class right after the UIViewController declaration add this: 
    ```swift
    SFSafariViewControllerDelegate
    ```
28. Create a new function called showWebPage()
    1. Add this code to the showWebPage function
        ```swift
        // students web page, blog, portfolio entered as a string below
        let urlString = "https://www.swiftteacher.org"
        
        if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
        let config = SFSafariViewController.Configuration()
        config.entersReaderIfAvailable = true
        
        let view = SFSafariViewController(url: url, configuration: config)
        view.delegate = self
        present(view, animated: true)
        }
        ```
29. Open Main.storyboard
    1. Open the Assistant Editor
    2. Connect the skills button to an action to open the webpage by control-dragging from the Skills button to under the `callMyName` function which is under the `viewDidLoad()` method. Name the action `skillsButtonTapped`.
    3. Call 
    ```
    showWebPage()
    ```
    inside of 
    ```swift
    @IBAction func skillsButtonTapped(_ sender: Any)
    ```
30. Build and run. Tap the Skills button to verify that the correct webpage loads. 
31. If everything works as expected:
    1. Commit the changes and create the remote branch in the process.
    2. Right-click the ‚ÄúMain‚Äù branch and click the ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù button. 
    3. Right-click on the ‚Äúwebportfolio‚Äù  branch and choose ‚ÄúMerge ‚Äúwebportfolio‚Äù into ‚Äúmain‚Äù‚Äù. Then click the ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù button.
    4. In the Menu bar, click Source Control > Push. This will send the changes just merged into the main branch to the main branch on GitHub or your chosen repository hosting service.
32. How can we make it better?
    1. Have the Education button load a pdf version resume we previously made in the Activate lesson.
    2. Add the share button to the pdf so that any prospective employer can email or message the resume to themselves.
33. Loading a PDF Resume from the apps internal storage and add the share button
    1. Go to the Source Control Navigator and add a new branch and name it ‚Äúresume‚Äù
    2. Open Pages and export your resume from Pages as a PDF.
    3. Add your resume to your project by dragging it into Project Navigator under the assets.xcassets folder. ‚ÄúCopy files if needed‚Äù and ‚ÄúFolder references‚Äù must be selected as show below.
        *See screenshot in pdf file.*
    4. Break the connection from the Experience button to the Experience screen by clicking on the segue that connects the Home Screen to the Experience screen and then delete that arrow.
    5. Open the Object Library add a View Controller in Main Storyboard. 
    6. Create a Show segue from the Experience button to the new View Controller.
    7. Add a new Cocoa Touch Class file to your project. File > New > File > Cocoa Touch Class and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù. Set your new file to be a subclass of UIViewController and name your file ResumeViewController and click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.
    8. Switch back to Main.storyboard. Select your newest View Controller. Click the Identity Inspector in the Inspector Pane. In the top section, Custom Class, start typing Resume and then hit return once autocomplete fills in the name ResumeViewController (you will probably only have to type ‚ÄúRe‚Äù and then you will see ResumeViewController in the box.
    9. At the very top of ResumeViewController.swift file above the import UIKit statement, add this statement: 
    ```swift
    import PDFKit
    ```

34. Switch to ResumeViewController.swift. At the top of the class create a constant called resume and use this code to assign the value to your resume that you dragged into Navigator Pane earlier (be sure to use code completion in Xcode to avoid typos):

```swift
        let resume = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "MyResume_project_example", withExtension: "pdf")
```
35. Add this new property to the Instance Properties section of the code:

```swift
        // creates a PDFview that uses the PDFView class to gain access to all of the PDFKit framework functionality.
        let pdfView = PDFView()
```
36.  Add this code to the bottom of `viewDidLoad()`:

        ```swift
        // needs to be false or pdf may not show in the view
        pdfView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        // adds the pdfView to your view
        view.addSubview(pdfView)
        ```
```swift
        // Unwraps an this optional value and if it finds nil inside it exits.
        guard let path = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "MyResume_project_example", withExtension: "pdf") else { return }
        
        // Unwraps this optional value. If there is a value our document will load, if nil the loop exits.
        guard let document = PDFDocument(url: path) else {return}
        
        pdfView.document = document
```

37.  Add this code to the bottom of `UIViewController` class:

    // #37
```swift
    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()
        pdfView.frame = view.bounds
    }
```

38. Build and run. Tap the Experience button to ensure that your resume loads and is viewable. We are going to add the share button programmatically. To do this programmatically we are going to use Objective-C functions. In Swift we can do this by bridging to Objective-C and using the `@objc` keyword before the `func` keyword. Create an Objective-C Swift function called `shareTapped()` by using this code: 
    ```swift
    @objc func shareTapped()
    ```
39. Add this code to the `shareTapped()` function:
```swift
        // Unwraps the resume doc (just in case there is no document to be loaded) and if there is no document it will exit
        guard let document = resume else { return }
        // Creates a message to be shared with your resume
        let message = "This is Brian Foutty's resume. It looks great. Doesn't it make you want to offer him the job."
        // Creates the share view that shares the loads the array of items to be shared - in this case your resume and your message for the interviewer.
        let view = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [document, message], applicationActivities: [])
        // Shows the view as a popover from a rightBarButtonItem
        view.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
        // presents the view when the share button is tapped
        present(view, animated: true)
```
40. Now that we have created the function that will give the share button its functionality. We will create the share button in code. Add this code towards the top of the `viewDidLoad()` right under the `pdfView` constant:
```swift
        // Adds the share button
        navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .action, target: self, action: #selector(shareTapped))
```
41. One last finishing touch. We can programmatically add a title to the Navigation Bar so that reinforces who we are so that our name resonates with the interviewer:
    ```swift
    // Adds a title to the navigation bar. We will set the large title to false so that the title is not jarring and does not take away from the presentation of your resume.
    title = "Your Name"
    navigationController?.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = false
    ```
42. Build and run. Tap the Experience button, ensure your resume loads, tap the share button to determine the share button functions as it should.
43. If you are happy with the updated version of the Skills screen:
    1. Commit the changes to the resume branch.
    2. Right-click the ‚ÄúMain‚Äù branch and choose ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù. Click the ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù button.
    3. Right-click on the ‚Äúresume‚Äù  branch and choose ‚ÄúMerge ‚Äúresume‚Äù into ‚Äúmain‚Äù‚Äù. Then click the ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù button.
    4. In the Menu bar, click Source Control > Push. This will send the changes just merged into the main branch to the main branch on GitHub or your chosen repository hosting service.
44. This updated version of the app is now complete. Congratulations!!
